      title: "Team Tendencies",
      content: `
## Offensive Patterns
* High-volume three-point shooting team (37.9% on 38.4 attempts per game)
* Strong ball movement (25.2 assists per game)
* Elite in transition scoring (14.6 fast break points per game)
* Relies heavily on creating mismatches and exploiting them
* Tendency to go through scoring droughts when three-pointers aren't falling

## Defensive Patterns
* Versatile defenders who switch frequently on screens
* Strong perimeter defense limiting opponent three-point attempts
* Excellent at forcing turnovers (8.6 steals per game)
* Occasional vulnerability in interior defense
* Strength in defensive rebounding limiting second-chance opportunities
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Key Players",
      content: `
## Jayson Tatum (F, #0)
* Leading scorer averaging 27.6 PPG
* Three-level scorer with strong isolation game
* Favors step-back jumpers and drives to his right
* Can be forced into difficult shots with physicality
* Capable playmaker when double-teamed (4.8 APG)

## Jaylen Brown (F, #7)
* Dynamic slasher and finisher (25.3 PPG)
* Improved ball-handler and mid-range shooter
* Explosive in transition
* Can be turnover-prone when pressured
* Streaky three-point shooter (36.9%)

## Kristaps Porzingis (C, #8)
* Stretch big who creates spacing (20.1 PPG)
* Elite rim protector (2.2 BPG)
* Pick-and-pop threat from beyond the arc
* Can be exploited in pick-and-roll defense
* Injury history has limited minutes in some games
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Strengths and Weaknesses",
      content: `
## Strengths
* Elite three-point shooting team
* Multiple playmakers and scorers
* Versatile defenders at multiple positions
* Strong in transition offense
* Excellent free throw shooting team (82.5%)
* Championship experience and poise in close games

## Weaknesses
* Occasional over-reliance on jump shots
* Bench depth can be inconsistent
* Vulnerable to physical play in the paint
* Can be turnover-prone against aggressive defenses
* Tendency to have stretches of stagnant offense
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Defensive Strategies",
      content: `
## Recommended Approach
* Force mid-range jumpers rather than threes or rim attempts
* Physical defense on Tatum to disrupt his rhythm
* Trap Brown in the corners to force turnovers
* Make Porzingis defend in space on pick-and-rolls
* Limit transition opportunities by emphasizing floor balance
* Push the pace on offense to test their defensive transition
* Target weaker defenders in pick-and-roll actions
* Control defensive glass to prevent second-chance points
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Offensive Strategies",
      content: `
## Recommended Approach
* Attack the paint consistently to draw fouls and create open shots
* Use pick-and-roll to target Porzingis in space
* Push pace after Celtics missed threes to attack before defense sets
* Utilize off-ball screens to free shooters from their switching defense
* Attack closeouts as Celtics defenders tend to be aggressive
* Create mismatches through screening actions
* Use motion offense to combat their switching defensive scheme
* Emphasize offensive rebounding - they can be vulnerable on the glass
